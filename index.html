        1. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
        configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
        eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible to
        trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may be
        applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added to an Apple Gift
        Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying device
        matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales tax may
        be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In-store trade-in
        requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may require saving
        this information). Offer may not be available in all stores, and may
        vary between in-store and online trade-in. Some stores may have
        additional requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the
        right to refuse or limit quantity of any trade-in transaction for any
        reason. More details are available from Appleâ€™s trade-in partner for
        trade-in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations
        may apply. To access and use all Apple Card features and products
        available only to Apple Card users, you must add Apple Card to Wallet on
        an iPhone or iPad that supports and has the latest version of iOS or
        iPadOS. Apple Card is subject to credit approval, available only for
        qualifying applicants in the United States, and issued by Goldman Sachs
        Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. If you reside in the U.S. territories,
        please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about Apple
        Card. Learn more about how Apple Card applications are evaluated at
